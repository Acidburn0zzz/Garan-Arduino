Garan-Arduino
=============

Unofficial libraries and exmaple code to verify [Garan Audio Module](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/garan-audio-module-p-1607.html).

It's not perfect, but it's working.

SoftwareSerial works great as the communication to Garan. Just assign a pair of RX/TX, store some MP3 files in the micro-SD card, and your are ready to go.

Examples
--------

There are 2 examples for now.

* Garan_Console -- Use Serial Monitor and your keyboard to test some commands.
* UltraSonicRanger_Reading -- Report the reading from an Ultra Sonic Ranger every 3 second.
